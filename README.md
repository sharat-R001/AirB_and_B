## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings in New York City for 2024. The analysis highlights trends in pricing, availability, room types, and host activity across boroughs. Visualizations are used to support insights and improve interpretability.

## Objectives
- Analyze distribution of room types and listing prices.
- Identify pricing trends across different neighborhoods.
- Examine host behavior and listing frequency.
- Detect price outliers and availability patterns.
- Provide actionable insights for hosts and guests.

## Dataset Summary
- **Rows:** 20,765  
- **Columns:** 22  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `id`, `name`, `host_name`

## Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in key columns (`price`, `beds`, `neighbourhood`).
- Converted `last_review` to datetime format.
- Capped extreme outlier prices above $1,000 for better visualization.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Room Types:** Bar plots to show frequency distribution.
- **Neighborhood Trends:** Grouped data by borough to compare pricing.
- **Price Distribution:** Histograms to understand price range.
- **Availability:** Heatmaps and pairplots to observe correlations.
- **Host Listings:** Boxplots to analyze multi-property hosts.
- **Review Activity:** Visualized relationship between reviews, price, and availability.
